part3: 
installed virtualbox on windows for ubuntu 16
since pyspark is still unavailable for python 3.6 and the latest ubuntu (18) comes with python 3.6, I installed ubuntu 16 that has built-in python 3.5
also installed jupyter notebook. 
with this ==> pip3 install findspark  ==> we will have our spark global.
we have to import findspark 
then we say: findspark.init('<working_path'>)
after this we can simply call spark from any folder.
linux : pwd: ==>print working directory.
